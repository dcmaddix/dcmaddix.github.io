Featured [blog](https://www.amazon.science/blog/mitra-mixed-synthetic-priors-for-enhancing-tabular-foundation-models) by Amazon Science on our tabular foundation model Mitra, which is trained purely on synthetic data and obtains state-of-the-art performance on classification and regression tasks. Mitra is available in [AutoGluon 1.4](https://auto.gluon.ai/stable/tutorials/tabular/tabular-foundational-models.html), and we have also released the weights on HuggingFace. Find the Mitra classifier [here](https://huggingface.co/autogluon/mitra-classifier) and regressor [here](https://huggingface.co/autogluon/mitra-regressor).
