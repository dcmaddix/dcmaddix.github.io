I taught and developed an Advanced MATLAB course aimed for graduate student scientists and engineers, covering topics including data structures, memory management, advanced graphics in higher dimensions, code optimization and debugging, object-oriented programming, compiled MATLAB (MEX files and MATLAB coder), and optimization, parallel computing, symbolic math and PDEs toolboxes.

I taught an on-campus version as well as an open source public version of the course that is available at the following link that had up to 5000 students enrolled worldwide: [Link](https://explorecourses.stanford.edu/search?view=catalog&filter-coursestatus-Active=on&q=CME%20292:%20Advanced%20MATLAB%20for%20Scientific%20Computing&academicYear=20162017)
