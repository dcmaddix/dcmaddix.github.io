I taught and developed the materials for a course on operational time series forecasting covering classical local state space models, e.g., ARIMA and ETS and deep learning models, e.g., DeepAR. In addition, we covered how to use the [GluonTS](https://github.com/awslabs/gluonts) time series toolkit.
