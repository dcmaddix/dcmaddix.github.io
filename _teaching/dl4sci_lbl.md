I am a co-organizer of the [Deep Learning for Science Summer School](https://sites.google.com/lbl.gov/dl4sci2026/home?authuser=0) at the Lawrence Berkeley Lab (LBL).
We will cover topics ranging from foundation models for science, agentic AI for science and deployment of AI into simulation pipelines.
