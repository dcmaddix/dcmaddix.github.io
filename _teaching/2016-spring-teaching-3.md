I  was the organizer of the 2016 [ICME Data Science Workshops](https://icme.stanford.edu/get-involved/annual-events-icme/icme-summer-workshops), which covered the fundamentals of data science for Stanford students and professionals in industry.
I was also the instructor of the Advanced MATLAB workshop.
