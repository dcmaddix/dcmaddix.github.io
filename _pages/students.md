I have been fortunate to advise and co-advise several PhD student interns:

  - [Xiaoyong Jin](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=EWiYf7YAAAAJ&hl=en), University of California, Santa Barbara, 2020-2022. [Domain Adaptation for Time Series Forecasting via Attention Sharing](https://proceedings.mlr.press/v162/jin22d/jin22d.pdf).
    - I am now managing Xiaoyong since he joined our ML Forecasting team at AWS AI Labs after graduation with his PhD in Computer Science.
  - [Rui (Ray) Wang](https://rui1521.github.io/online-cv/), University of California, San Diego, 2020. [Bridging Physics-based and Data-driven modeling for Learning Dynamical Systems](http://proceedings.mlr.press/v144/wang21a/wang21a.pdf)
    - PhD Candidate in Computer Science
    - Advisor: [Rose Yu](https://roseyu.com/)
