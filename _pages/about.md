I am interested in the intersection of machine learning and scientific computing for simulating physical systems. I graduated from UC Berkeley with highest honors in Applied Mathematics from the University of California, Berkeley in 2012. I then graduated from the Institute of Computational and Mathematical Engineering (ICME) at Stanford University with my Masters of Science in 2015 and with my PhD in Computational and Mathematical Engineering in 2018. I was advised by Professor Margot Gerritsen.
