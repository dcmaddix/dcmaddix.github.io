*Chapter 5: Structure preservation in finite volume ROMs via physics-based constraints*

I researched adding conservation and total variation diminishing (TVD) constraints to ROMs to make the low-dimensional ROM solution be physically meaningful (conservative) and remove artifical oscillations.  We test on the nonlinear hyperbolic conservation laws: Burgers' equation and Sod's shock tube problem.
