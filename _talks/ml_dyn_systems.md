Please find my invited talk on "Physics-constrained Machine Learning for Scientific Computing" at [Machine Learning and Dynamical Systems Seminar](https://www.turing.ac.uk/research/interest-groups/machine-learning-and-dynamical-systems) at the Alan Turing Institute [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ag5qEEYTNFg). The talk covers our following three research works:
  - [Bridging Physics-based and Data-driven modeling for Learning Dynamical Systems](http://proceedings.mlr.press/v144/wang21a/wang21a.pdf), L4DC, 2021.
  - [Learning Physical Models that Can Respect Conservation Laws](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2302.11002.pdf), Under review, 2023.
  - [Guiding Continuous Operator Learning through Physics-based boundary constraints](https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.07477), ICLR, 2023.
