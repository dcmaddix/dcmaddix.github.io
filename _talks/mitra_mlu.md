I spoke at the Machine Learning University (MLU) on our custom tabular foundation model (TFM), Mitra, which is trained purely on synthetic data.
We released Mitra in [AutoGluon 1.4](https://github.com/autogluon/autogluon). See the [tutorial](https://auto.gluon.ai/stable/tutorials/tabular/tabular-foundational-models.html) on how to call Mitra with only 3 lines of code in AutoGluon 1.4.
We have also released the weights on HuggingFace. Find the Mitra classifier [here](https://huggingface.co/autogluon/mitra-classifier) and regressor [here](https://huggingface.co/autogluon/mitra-regressor).
