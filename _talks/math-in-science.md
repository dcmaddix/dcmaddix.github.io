Please find my talk [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/168kDOQXnGrK811CB6NXhXUkPUiOxLc2j/view ).

In this talk, I discuss the prevalence of mathematics in science to aspiring young scientists. In particular, I discuss the beauty of the Navier-Stokes equations in several fluid flow applications, including climate and weather modeling, aerodynamics and blood flow through the heart.
