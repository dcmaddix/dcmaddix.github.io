[ICML Time Series Workshop Talk](https://slideslive.com/38917683/neural-time-series-models-with-gluonts)

Here we describe our [GluonTS](https://github.com/awslabs/gluonts) open-source package for probabilistic time series modeling in Python. It contains both classical state space models and deep learning models.

I also presented this at the Amazon Conference for Machine Learning (AMLC) in Seattle in July 2019.
