[ICML Time Series Workshop Talk](https://slideslive.com/38917683/neural-time-series-models-with-gluonts)

Here we describe our [GluonTS](https://github.com/awslabs/gluonts) open-source Python package for probabilistic time series modeling. It contains both classical state space models and deep learning models.

I also presented on GluonTS at the following venues:
  - The Amazon Conference for Machine Learning (AMLC) in Seattle in July 2019
  - The Mayo Clinic
  - Time Series Meetup hosted by Meta in June 2022, which included our latest research:
    - [Incremental Quantile Function (IQF)](https://proceedings.mlr.press/v151/park22a.html)
    - [Domain Adaptation Forecaster (DAF)](https://proceedings.mlr.press/v162/jin22d/jin22d.pdf)
